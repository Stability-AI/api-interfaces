Proof of concept for a simplified Protobuf development experience
- Only ts-protoc-gen needs to be installed on the host machine (run `npm install` or `yarn`) all other dependencies are handled by Buf remote generation.

Commands:
  - `yarn generate` Regenerate outputs in `gen` directory from protobuf definitions
